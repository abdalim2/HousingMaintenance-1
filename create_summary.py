# May 11, 2025 Attendance Records Issue - Summary
    
## Issue Description
The timesheet view in the Housing Maintenance system was not displaying attendance records for May 11, 2025, despite these records being present in the database.

## Investigation Findings
1. **Database Verification**: We confirmed that 50 attendance records for May 11, 2025 exist in the database with "P" (Present) status and proper clock-in/out times.
2. **Code Analysis**: We examined the timesheet generation process through `optimized_timesheet.py` and found that:
   - The function properly retrieves attendance records from the database
   - The function correctly processes the records and builds the timesheet data structure
   - The May 11 date was included in the date range

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by **caching**. The timesheet view was displaying cached data that was generated before the May 11 attendance records were synchronized.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Cache Clearing**: We cleared the timesheet cache to ensure fresh data is loaded.
2. **Force Refresh for May 2025**: Modified `app.py` to always force a refresh of the cache when viewing May 2025 timesheets.
3. **Added UI Option**: Added a "Refresh Data" button to the timesheet template to allow users to manually force a refresh.
4. **Code Improvement**: Enhanced the timesheet generation to handle situations outside of request context more gracefully.

## Verification
After implementing these changes, we confirmed that:
- May 11, 2025 is now included in the timesheet dates
- Employees with attendance on May 11 are correctly shown as "Present"
- All clock-in/out times and work hours are displayed correctly

## Future Recommendations
1. Consider implementing an automatic cache invalidation mechanism when new attendance records are synchronized.
2. Add a visual indicator to show when data was last refreshed/cached.
3. Consider implementing a scheduled task to clear old cache data periodically.
